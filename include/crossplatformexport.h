/**
    @file
    @brief This file is used on some platforms to determine what data should be read and written to
    and from a shared/dynamic library.
    @details Currently this file uses __declspec(dllexport) and __declspec(dllimport) on the windows
    platform to control what is imported from or exported to the Mezzanine DLL. If MEZZ_WINDOWS if
    defined then MEZZ_LIB will be set to either "__declspec(dllexport)" or "__declspec(dllimport)".
    Every Class, function variable, and other item intended to be in Mezzanine is tagged with
    MEZZ_LIB.

    @n @n
    During compilation of the Mezzanine engine __declspec(dllexport) tells the compiler that a given
    item (a function, class, etc...), should be included in the dll and made available for use in
    games (or whatever kind of applicaitons use Mezzanine). This header sets MEZZ_LIB to
    __declspec(dllexport) if EXPORTINGMEZZANINEDLL is set. If Mezzanine is compiled using the cmake
    build provided then this is handle automatically. If the cmake build is not used, then this file
    will attempt to detect if the platform t is running on is windows or not. It is preferable that
    you configure your build environment to define MEZZ_WINDOWS and EXPORTINGMEZZANINEDLL if you are
    compiling this on windows without the provided cmake build. \n \n

    Compilation of applications using Mezzanine __declspec(dllimport), tells the compiler what to
    expect from the dll and may make optimizations available with some compilers. This is
    automatically set if you use the cmake build, if you aren't this file will attempt to determine
    if you are running windows. It is best to set the build envirnoment of your game or applciation
    to define MEZZ_WINDOWS, if possible copy of our cmake builds for Catch! or the EngineDemo.

    @n @n
    The Macro MEZZ_LIB is declared as empty if MEZZ_WINDOWS is not defined, as should be the case if
    MEZZ_LINUX or MEZZ_MACOSX is defined. \n \n
