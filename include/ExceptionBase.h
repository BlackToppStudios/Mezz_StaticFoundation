/// This macro makes doing all of these easy. Every exception thrown by this macro with provide the function name, the
/// file name and the line in the file from which it was thrown. That provides all the information the developer needs
/// to identify the issue. This uses some specific template machinery to generate specifically typed exceptions static
/// instances at compile to insure the behaviors a programmer needs, specifically capturing the line, function, file and
/// class of the exception in the error message. Since these are allocated (optimized out really) when the program
/// is first loaded so there will be no allocations when this is called, and the type is controlled
/// by the error number parameter.
/// @n @n
/// As long as the developer provides a unique string for each failure, then any messages logged or presented to the

/// and potentially allows troubleshooters/technicians to skip lengthy diagnostics steps.
