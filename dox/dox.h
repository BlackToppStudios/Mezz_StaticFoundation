/// @file
/// @brief The main documentation header to include for this library

/// @page Mezz_StaticFoundation Jagati Library Static Foundation
/// This is library provides basic OS feature detection facilities for C++ code and SWIG bound
/// languages. This library can be used by adding it to your project as you would any other
/// @ref Jagati library and include @ref staticfoundation.h. The class @ref Mezzanine::RuntimeStatic
/// describes all options detected that can be used by SWIG bound libraries or queried at runtime by
/// C++ code. Here is a list of all Preprocessor definitions and what they do:
///
///     - @ref MEZZ_BuildDoxygen - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the doxygen build option
/// was set.
///     - @ref MEZZ_BuildStaticLibraries - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the build option
/// to build static libraries was set. This defaults to true. Dynamic libraries will be built
/// otherwise.
///     - @ref MEZZ_Linux  - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if CMake dectects a Linux build
/// environment.
///     - @ref MEZZ_Windows  - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if CMake dectects a Windows build
/// environment.
///     - @ref MEZZ_MacOSX  - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if CMake dectects a Mac OS X build
/// environment.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerIsGCC  - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the compiler is GCC,
/// Mingw or TDM-GCC.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerIsClang  - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the compiler is Clang.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerIsIntel  - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the compiler Intel.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerIsMsvc  - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set only if the compiler is
/// MSVC.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerDesignNix  - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set for pretty much all
/// compilers except MSVC.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerDesignMS  - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set only when using MSVC

/// @file StaticFoundationConfig.h
/// @details This file is generated automatically by the CMake build process in the Static
/// Foundation Jagati Package.

/// @def MEZZ_BuildDoxygen
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. This is a CMake Option set in
/// the StaticFoundation. If set an extra build step is added that adds a build target which runs
/// doxygen against every Jagati package in the build.

/// @def MEZZ_BuildStaticLibraries
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. This is set by cmake option
/// and on supported platforms this will allow choosing between static libraries (.a/.lib) and
/// dynamix libraries (.so/.dll).

/// @def MEZZ_Linux
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if Linux is the target
/// platform, unset otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_Windows
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if windows is the target
/// platform, unset otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_MacOSX
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if Mac OS X is the target
/// platform, unset otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerIsGCC
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the current build is
/// being done with GCC, false otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerIsClang
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the current build is
/// being done with Clang, false otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerIsIntel
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the current build is
/// being done with the Intel compiler, false otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerIsMsvc
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the current build is
/// being done with msvc, false otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerDesignNix
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the compiler accepts
/// arguments and pragmas generally like Unix style compilers.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerDesignMS
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the compiler accepts
/// arguments and pragmas generally like ms style compilers.
