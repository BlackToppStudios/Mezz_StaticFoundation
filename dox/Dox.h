/// @file
/// @brief The main documentation header to include for this library

/// @page Mezz_StaticFoundation Jagati Library Static Foundation
/// This is library provides basic OS feature detection facilities for C++ code and SWIG bound languages. This library
/// can be used by adding it to your project as you would any other @ref Jagati library and include
/// @ref StaticFoundation.h. The class @ref Mezzanine::RuntimeStatic describes all options detected that can be used by
/// SWIG bound libraries or queried at runtime by C++ code. Here is a list of all Preprocessor definitions and what they
/// do:
///
///     - @ref MEZZ_BuildDoxygen - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the doxygen build option was set.
///     - @ref MEZZ_BuildStaticLibraries - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the build option to build static
/// libraries was set. This defaults to true. Dynamic libraries will be built otherwise.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CodeCoverage - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if code coverage requested by project.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CpuKnown - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the CPU type could be detected.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CpuX86 - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the CPU is known is x86 or Amd64.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CpuAmd64 - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the CPU is known is Amd64.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CpuArm - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the CPU is known is Arm.
///     - @ref MEZZ_Linux - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if CMake dectects a Linux build environment.
///     - @ref MEZZ_Windows - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if CMake dectects a Windows build environment.
///     - @ref MEZZ_MacOSX - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if CMake dectects a Mac OS X build environment.
///     - @ref MEZZ_Ios - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if CMake dectects a cross compile for IOS.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerDetected - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if CMake dectects the compiler, so its set.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerIsClang - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the compiler is Clang.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerIsEmscripten  - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the compiler is Emscripten.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerIsGCC - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the compiler is GCC, Mingw or TDM-GCC.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerIsIntel - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the compiler Intel.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerIsMsvc - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set only if the compiler is MSVC.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerDesignNix - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set for pretty much all compilers except MSVC.
///     - @ref MEZZ_CompilerDesignMS - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set only when using MSVC
///     - @ref MEZZ_Arch64 - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set only if the build is 64 bit.
///     - @ref MEZZ_Arch32 - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set only if the build is 64 bit.
///     - @ref MEZZ_Debug - @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h - Set if the build includes debug symbols.

/// @file StaticFoundationConfig.h
/// @details This file is generated automatically by the CMake build process in the Static Foundation Jagati Package.

/// @def MEZZ_BuildDoxygen
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. This is a CMake Option set in the
/// StaticFoundation. If set an extra build step is added that adds a build target which runs doxygen against every
/// Jagati package in the build.

/// @def MEZZ_BuildStaticLibraries
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. This is set by cmake option and on supported
/// platforms this will allow choosing between static libraries (.a/.lib) and dynamic libraries (.so/.dll).

/// @def MEZZ_CodeCoverage
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. This is set if the project calls the
/// SetCodeCoverage CMake macro. If set extra files will be generated during the build (on supported compilers) and
/// test coverage can be tracked.

/// @def MEZZ_CpuKnown
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. This is set when CPU detection worked, which it
/// often doesn't. If this is not set then none of the other Mezz_Cpu macros will be set,so check this first.

/// @def MEZZ_CpuX86
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. This is set when CPU detection worked, and the
/// current CPU is x86 compatible. This is set when Amd64 is set or whenever the current CPU is compatible with intel,
/// so it should be true Via, Amd and a few other CPUs are used.

/// @def MEZZ_CpuAmd64
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. This is set when CPU detection worked, and the
/// current CPU is Amd64 compatible. This is set when using and Amd64 CPU or one compatible like any Emt64 CPU, but not
/// itanium.

/// @def MEZZ_CpuArm
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. This is set when CPU detection worked, and the
/// current CPU is Arm compatible.

/// @def MEZZ_Linux
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if Linux is the target platform, unset
/// otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_Windows
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if windows is the target platform, unset
/// otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_MacOSX
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if Mac OS X is the target platform, unset
/// otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_Ios
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if this is a cross-compile for IOS or this is
/// being built on an IOS device.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerDetected
/// @brief Pretty much always set, the Jagati bails if it cannot find the compiler. This may be used in the future when
/// cross-compiling could complicate matters.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerIsClang
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the current build is done with Clang,
/// false otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerIsGCC
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the current build is done with GCC,
/// false otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerIsEmscripten
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the current build is done with Emscripten
/// false otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerIsIntel
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the current build is done with the Intel
/// compiler, false otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerIsMsvc
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the current build is done with msvc,
/// false otherwise.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerDesignNix
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the compiler accepts arguments and pragmas
/// generally like Unix style compilers.

/// @def MEZZ_CompilerDesignMS
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the compiler accepts arguments and pragmas
/// generally like ms style compilers.

/// @def MEZZ_Arch64
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the compiler thinks it is on a 64 bit
/// platform.

/// @def MEZZ_Arch32
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the compiler thinks it is on a 32 bit
/// platform.

/// @def MEZZ_Debug
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the compiler includes debugging info.

/// @def MEZZ_CodeCoverage
/// @brief A Preprocessor macro set in @ref StaticFoundationConfig.h. Set if the compiler includes code coverage info.

/// @def INCLUDE_STD_FILESYSTEM_EXPERIMENTAL
/// @brief Used by the Static Foundation DataTypes.h header to aid in detecting the correct filesystem header.
